# data_visualization_practice

This repo contains some practice of visualizations for data analysis purpose. It mainly contains practice for:
- Univariate Exploration
- Bivariate Exploration
- Multivariate Exploration
- Explanatory Visulizations

All codes written in Jupyter Notebook, and the packages used for visualizations are Matplotlib and Seaborn.

**Note:**
These codes are originally from Udacity Data Analysis Nano Degree Program. 
The part I wrote is to complete the tasks in original Jupyter notebooks.
